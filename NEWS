CHANGES BETWEEN LISPEL VERSIONS
-------------------------------


* Changes from 0.0.4 to 0.0.3					unreleased

 - many, many code changes to add full ANSI-C++ compliance
 - use external MiscClass class library

* Changes from 0.0.3 to 0.0.2					unreleased

 - improved scanner with support for character constants and proper
   backslash substitution
 - the sample command line driver can now be used as a UN*X script interpreter
   (new comment introducer #!)
 - improved error reporting
 - proper handling of quoting character
 - many bugfixes
 ! this version wasn't released because of some bugs that would be fixed by
   a new implementation of some components, which is scheduled for 0.1.0


* Changes from 0.0.2 to 0.0.1					21-nov-1999

 - better exception handling: uses a tree of exception classes, uses throw
   declarations
 - hashtable data type added
 - added keywords known from ANSI Common Lisp
 - improved lambda implementation (body can be a list of expressions)
 - more than 50 builtins, important special forms cond, let, let* added


* Version 0.0.1							15-nov-1999

 - This is a very first implementation of the core of an interpreter for a
   Lisp- (or Scheme-)like extension language. It serves as a prototype, only,
   so many components will be replaced before the next major version comes out.
