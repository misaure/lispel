<blockquote>
This glossary isn't intended to demonstrate that I am Mr. Knowitall, I rather
want to make sure that I use some common terms in a way commonly agreed upon.
As I am (as you will already have realized) no native speaker of English,
I am often unsure about how to exactly use a certain term.
If you become aware of any misconceptions, please drop me a short note.

<ul>
<li><strong>Builtin:</strong><br>
 I use this term to refer to functions and special forms implemented as
 C++ classes or functions.
