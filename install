INSTALLING LISPEL 0.0.3	

 The Lispel package is prepared to use the GNU tools for automatically
 generating platform specific configuration information, but I don't
 expect that it currently works. 

 To compile and install lispel, you should do the following:
 1) have a look at the Makefile.simple in the subdirectory lispel to check if
    the settings are ok for you
 2) run 'make -f Makefile.simple'
 3) if you want to run the test programs, change to the directory tests and
    check the Makefile.simple
 4) run 'make -f Makefile.simple'
 5) run the shell script runtests
 6) if all works correctly, copy the files in lispel to wherever you want them
    to reside, e.g.
    cp lispel /usr/local/bin
    mkdir /usr/local/include/lispel
    cp *.hh /usr/local/include/lispel
    cp libispel.a /usr/local/lib

 This first version of Lispel doesn't need any platform specific information,
 the only thing really needed to compile is a fairly recent version of gcc
 or egcs. Lispel has been successfully compiled on DOS, Windows and Linux using
 egcs 1.1.2 and gcc 2.95.1.


MAKE ARGUMENTS

  When running make, you can specify some options on the command line in the
  form 'arg=var'. These are:

    debug	Set this to 'yes' to create a lispel version which produces a
    		lot of output while executing lispel programs.
