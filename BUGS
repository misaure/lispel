Known bugs:

013 the interpreter seems to have some serious problems with undefined
    character constants.

012 lambda throws an unrecoverable exception when an empty argument list is
    encountered
    test: test7.scm

011 the set implementation doesn't work because there is currently no adequate
    comparison operator for instantiating the STL set class used as an
    implementation base.

010 there seems to be some kind of problem with EOF characters when sourcing
    files using the sample shells --file option.
    test: simply press CTRL-D while in the Lispel shell.   [fixed, 21-dec-1999]

009 hash-keys always returns a list of quoted string, disregarding the fact that
    keywords or symbols might have been used as keys

008 set-car! and set-cdr! expose strange behaviour
    test: list0.scm					   [fixed, 18-nov-1999]

007 it seems as if vector constants weren't read correctly; they don't seem to
    be treated as a single object			   [fixed, 18-nov-1999]

006 the lexer doesn't work correctly on string containing (backslash quoted)
    strings.
    test: scanner0 string2.tst
    workaround: none; lexer module needs some optimizations which will include
    a fix for this; as long as no other bugs are detected in the lexer, this
    fix/optimization will be delayed.			   [fixed, 28-nov-1999]

005 the SimpleGC garbage collector implementation always reports
    "0 cells freed". This might be worth some investigation ;-)
    							   [fixed, 12-nov-1999]

004 evaluating undefined symbols leads to a crash
    the crash is caused by throwing an exception when unbound symbols are
    encountered                                            [fixed, 05-nov-1999]

003 self-evaluating symbols produce crashes when evaluated on their own or as
    function names.
    test: interp0 test6.scm				   [fixed, 04-nov-1999]

002 the quoting character doesn't quite work
    the reason for this behaviour is known, but a fix will require some
    redesign, so it will be delayed until the next design iteration
    test: interp0 test5.scm
    workaround: use (quote ...) instead			   [fixed, 15-dec-1999]
    note: no 'redesign' needed :-)

001  the evaluator crashes on null-length expressions (aka (), aka nil)
     test: interp0 empty.scm                               [fixed, 03-nov-1999]
